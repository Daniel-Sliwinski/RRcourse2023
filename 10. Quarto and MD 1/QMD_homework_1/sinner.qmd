# The Sinner

#### Brief Description of the TV Show

_"The Sinner"_ is an American police procedural anthology television series developed by _"Derek Simonds"_ for USA Network. It is based on _"Petra Hammesfahr's"_ 1999 novel, which served as the basis for the first season. The series stars _"Bill Pullman"_ as a police detective who investigates crimes committed by unlikely culprits and attempts to uncover their motivations. Only _"Pullman"_ appears in every season, while the rest of the cast mostly changes for each season's story.

The show was intended as an eight-part miniseries, but its success led to it being turned into an anthology series, which aired for four seasons from August 2, 2017, to December 1, 2021.

The first season of _"The Sinner"_ received nominations for the **Golden Globe Award** for Best Miniseries or Television Film and Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film for _"Jessica Biel"_. _"Biel"_ was also nominated for a **Primetime Emmy Award** for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.

The show captivates viewers with deep dive in to psyche of the main characters, posing an essential question who are we and what is our dark side?

# The Sinner: A Statistical Overview

The *The Sinner* has had a dynamic viewership over its four seasons. The first season was met with a great reception, averaging **1.8 million** viewers per episode. This success led to the transformation of the show from an intended mini-series to a full-fledged multi-season series.

However, subsequent seasons saw a decline in viewership. The numbers fell to an average of **1.13 million** viewers per episode in the second season. The trend continued with the third season, which drew in an average of **0.65 million** viewers, and the fourth season, attracting an average of **0.45 million** viewers per episode.

While I found each season's story incredibly captivating, it seems that not everyone shares my feelings towards the later seasons.

To provide a more holistic view, let's consider the Rotten Tomato ratings for each season:

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Rotten Tomato ratings data
ratings_data <- data.frame(
  Season = c("Season 1", "Season 2", "Season 3", "Season 4"),
  Tomatometer = c("91%", "97%", "85%", "88%"),
  Audience_Score = c("87%", "82%", "46%", "77%")
)

# Display the data as a table
knitr::kable(ratings_data, caption = "Rotten Tomato Ratings for Each Season")
```

As the table shows, season 3 performed the worst, according to the audience score. However, critics rated season 2 slightly higher than the first season, as per the Tomatometer score.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Average viewership over the four seasons", warning=FALSE}
# Viewership data
viewership_data <- data.frame(
  Season = factor(c("Season 1", "Season 2", "Season 3", "Season 4"), 
                  levels = c("Season 1", "Season 2", "Season 3", "Season 4")),
  Average_Viewership = c(1.8, 1.13, 0.65, 0.45)
)

# Create the plot
ggplot(viewership_data, aes(x = Season, y = Average_Viewership)) +
  geom_line(group = 1, colour = "blue", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 3, colour = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Viewership Over the Four Seasons",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Average Viewership (in millions)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Change in viewership from season to season", warning=FALSE}
# Calculate the change in viewership from season to season
viewership_change <- viewership_data %>%
  mutate(Change_in_Viewership = c(NA, diff(Average_Viewership)))

# Create the plot
ggplot(viewership_change, aes(x = Season, y = Change_in_Viewership)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="steelblue") +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(Change_in_Viewership, 2)), vjust=-0.3, size=3.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Change in Viewership from Season to Season",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Change in Viewership (in millions)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-1.5, 1.5))  # Adjust this to fit your data
